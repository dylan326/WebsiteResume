# WebsiteResume

NYU JavaScript Class project.   This is a website I'll be updating and probably using as my personal website resume. The site uses a lot of jQuery and DOM manipulation along with HTML and CSS.   Also cookies are set so when a user returns there can be a personalized
welcome message
